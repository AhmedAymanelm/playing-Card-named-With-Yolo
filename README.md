# playing-Card-named-With-Yolo
This project uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to detect and recognize playing cards in real time. The system identifies the suit (♠, ♥, ♦, ♣) and value (A, 2–10, J, Q, K) of each card from a video or image. It can be used in card games automation, magic trick analysis, or as an educational tool for learning cards.
